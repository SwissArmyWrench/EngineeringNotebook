# The Engineering Notebook
... now available for all to read!

### Why keep an Engineering Notebook?
I was advised years ago by my friend Bob, who is an engineer of the old guard, that engineers worth their salt must always keep a log of their work. Especially for the hobbyist engineers like myself. Keeping records is crucial, not only to the process of engineering itself, but also for staking one's claim upon his work as a proof that the effort and labor were really put in. Bob suggested a notebook, and after having a few half-hearted attempts years ago while I was still in middle/high school and such, I have finally bought in and really stepped into the proper usage of a notebook, using a very nice notebook from Leuchtturm1917. 

I do all my real work for this stuff on paper in this book. For me, there is just something about pen and paper, and it's also the best medium for when a quick diagram or sketch is required. However, to make sure my documentation is still useful in the modern age, I have made the decision to transcribe all of my notes to Markdown and take scans of each diagram and figure. This repo is where they'll live, unless they are a part of a project that has its own dedicated repo, in which case this repo will just contain links to where to find that documentation in its most current state.
